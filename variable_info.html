The cold air advection amplifies the upper-level wave, which enhances upper-level divergence and intensifies the surface low.

The following conceptual diagram shows the secondary circulation associated with the entrance region of an upper-tropospheric jet streak. Vertical motion is due to sloped ascent of the accelerating low-level wind towards the upper-level divergence in the jet entrance region.

			<b>Potential vorticity (PV)</b> is a quantity which is proportional to the dot product of vorticity and stratification that, following a parcel of air or water, can only be changed by diabatic or frictional processes. It is a useful concept for understanding the generation of vorticity in cyclogenesis (the birth and development of a cyclone).
			<br><br>			
			Carl-Gustaf Rossby first introduced potential vorticity in his 1936 paper <a href="docs/potential_vorticity_rossby1936.pdf"> "Dynamics of steady ocean currents in the light of experimental fluid mechanics"</a>. This work was based on an analysis of a shallow water model of the Gulf Stream. The concept was developed further, within a few years of Rossby's seminal paper, by Hans Ertel. The definition follow as: the absolute vorticity  on  an  isentropic  (constant  potential temperature)  surface,  multiplied  by  the  static stability. Mathematically, Ertel's form of potential vorticity is given by the equation:
			<center><img src="images/pv_eq.png"></img></center>
			</p>
			<p align="left" style="font-size: 17px;"> where <img src="images/rho.png"></img> is the fluid density, <img src="images/vort.png"></img> is the absolute vorticity and <img src="images/gradient_ptemp.png"></img> is the gradient of the potential temperature. It can be shown through a combination of the first law of thermodynamics and momentum conservation that potential vorticity can only be changed by diabatic heating (such as latent heat released from condensation) or frictional processes. This conservation is the atmospheric equivalent to inertia. A spinning ice skater with her arms spread out laterally can accelerate her rate of spin by contracting her arms. Similarly, when a vortex of air is broad, it is in turn, slow.
			<br><br>
			When the air converges, to maintain potential vorticity, the air speed increases, resulting in a stretched ring vortex. Divergence causes the vortex to spread, slowing down the rate of spin.			
			</p>
			<center><img style="width: 500px" src="images/Potential_vorticity_conservation.png"></img></center>
			<p align="left" style="font-size: 17px;">
			There is a strong relationship between a dark Stripe in WV imagery and potential vorticity.
			<br><br>
			Values of PV less than 1.5 PVU (potential vorticity units) are typically associated with tropospheric air and values greater than 1.5 PVU are typically associated with stratospheric air. <b>Centers of higher potential vorticity ( >1.5 PVU) are called “potential vorticity anomalies”, or “PV anomalies” for short</b>. A distinction  can  be  made  between  positive  PV  anomalies  (associated  with  cyclonic  disturbances)  and  negative  PV  anomalies (associated  with  anticyclonic  circulations/ridges).
			<br><br>
			Values of 1.5 PVU (potential vorticity units) of the potential vorticity indicates the tropopause. A dark Stripe, as mentioned here, is a PV-anomaly.
			<center><img style="width: 500px" src="images/PVanomaly.gif"></img>
			<img style="width: 500px" src="images/tropopause_folding.gif"></img></center>
			</p>
			<p align="left" style="font-size: 17px;">
			The descending air with high values of PV penetrates into the (potentially) unstable layers in the lower part of the troposphere. PVA in front of the PV-anomalies enhances the convection, the convection could be dry but also moist, resulting in showers. This mechanism causes a strong variation in upward and downward motion near the surface and leads to extremely gusty winds.
