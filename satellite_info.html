			<b>WV - Water Vapour</b>
			<br><br>
			The satellite receives radiation which is emitted by the water vapour in the upper troposphere (approximately above 600 hPa up to 300 hPa). The WV channel represents an absorption measurement of the WV absorption band. This means that radiation from below 600 hPa is absorbed by the WV in the layer above which according to the radiation laws (Kirchhoff) becomes a radiating surface itself.  
			<br><br>
			Different grey shades in the WV channel represent different WV content above 600 hPa. High upper level WV (bright) help us to identify the location and orientation of jet axes. The dry areas (dark) are a sign of cyclogenesis as stratospheric (dry) air is protruding down:

			Airmass is an RGB composite based upon data from infrared and water vapour channels from Meteosat Second Generation. It is designed and tuned to monitor the evolution of cyclones, in particular rapid cyclogenesis, jet streaks and PV (potential vorticity) anomalies (appear reddish in the image).   
			<br><br>
			Due to the incorporation of the water vapour and ozone channels, its usage at high satellite viewing angles is limited. The Airmass RGB is composed from data from a combination of the SEVIRI WV6.2, WV7.3, IR9.7 and IR10.8 channels and can thus be used day and night.

			The Night Microphysics product is an RGB composite based upon the IR3.9 and the window channels of Meteosat Second Generation satellite. 
			<br><br>
			For fog/low-clouds the IR10.8 - IR3.9 yields a BTD of +6 to +10K which is much higher as opposed to the IR10.8 - IR8.7 BTD used in the 24 hour Microphysics RGB. It is thus better to monitor the evolution of fog/low stratus. Other (secondary) applications are the detection of fires and cloud classification in general.
			<br><br>
			However! Due to the CO2 absorption in the IR3.9 channel the use of this RGB is not suitable for high latitudes due to limb cooling. Another restriction resides in the fact that for cold scenes (i.e. -20°C and lower) the IR3.9 channel tends to become noisy and produces grain.
